# auto-tag.yml is intentionally retired.
#
# Git tag creation has moved into docker-publish.yml (the "merge" job) so that
# the git tag and the registry version tag are created atomically — only after
# both arch images are verified in GHCR and the multi-arch manifest is confirmed
# pullable.
#
# Previously this workflow:
#   1. Read the version from the root package.json  (wrong — root is private)
#   2. Created a git tag
#   3. Triggered docker-publish.yml via `gh workflow run`
#
# Problems that caused:
#   - Version sourced from private root package, not the published packages/stdio
#   - Docker publish was triggered even when the tag already existed
#   - Two Docker builds ran on every version bump (one from push-to-main, one
#     from the tag trigger), producing two registry pushes of the same image
#   - Git tag existed before images were verified, so tag and registry could
#     diverge on a failed publish
#
# The replacement flow (all in docker-publish.yml):
#   push to main → build & push amd64/arm64 → verify digests → merge manifest
#   → verify manifest pullable → create git tag → clean up staging tags
#
# This file is kept as documentation. It has no 'on:' trigger and will never run.
